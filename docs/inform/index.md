The Inform project is the unified response for the need of data-driven decision making in the Pacific thanks to the strategic partnership between Pacific Island Countries, the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) and the UN Environment Programme to increase the availability of environmental data.
