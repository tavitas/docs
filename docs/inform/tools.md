## Data Portals

The Inform project has created a network of national and regional data repositories to store, manage and share environmental data, to monitor the state of the Pacific's environment.

_"The Pacific Environment Portal provides an easy way to find, access and reuse regional and national data. Our main purpose is to provide easy access and safe storage for environmental datasets to be used for monitoring, evaluating, and analysing environmental conditions and trends to support environmental planning, forecasting, and reporting requirements at all levels. This Pacific Environment Portal is part of the Pacific Data Ecosystem, a partnership between Pacific Island Countries, SPREP and SPC. Visit the Pacific Data Hub for more data. The Pacific Environment Portal automatically pulls in data from national repositories. This provides back-up and redundancy for national repositories. The countries retain data ownership. The online repository can be used to store and access any data type including tables (Excel, CSV) documents (Word and PDF), GIS files (.geojson, .shp, .tab) and any other file type including non-environmental datasets."_

## The Indicator Reporting Tool

https://indicators.sprep.org

The indicator reporting tool is an online platform designed to make reporting environmental data easier for Pacific Islands Countries (PICs). The environment data portals were established in each Pacific Island country to meet the requirementes for an easy-to-use and safe repository for national environmental data. However, PICs identified the additional need to reduce the burden in meeting their reporting requirements, particularly under a growing number of multilateral environment agreements (MEAs).

The reporting tool has three main functions:

1. add and update environmental indicators
2. link indicators to targets under reporting obligations
3. produce reports. The key advantage of using the indicator reporting tool is that once an indicator has been updated, it can be reused for any number of reporting requirements and reports produced with the click of a button.
