## The SPREP Inform Project

Knowledge and understanding are important for driving and bringing about informed decision making. The project, "Building National and Regional Capacity to Implement Multilateral Environmental Agreements by Strengthening Planning and the State of Environmental Assessment and Reporting in the Pacific", referred to as the Inform project, recognises the need for this data-driven decision making. The project will establish a Pacific island network of national and regional data repositories and reporting tools to support the monitoring, evaluation, and analysis of environmental information, which supports environmental planning, forecasting, and reporting requirements.

The Inform project will help Pacific islands have reliable access to their own national datasets for environmental information, as well as a process and guide for information use standards. Capacity will be built to develop content that is then inputted into the reporting process. Additionally, the capacity of officers will be enhanced with regards to the best ways to share the information they have so it is well used by their decision makers and different communities. The information provided within the databases will also help policy development, monitoring and evaluation, and national planning.

Over a four-year period from 2017–2021, Inform will work in the Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

## Progress

The Inform project continues to help countries set up national environment portals, predominantly housed with national environment departments. So far national environment portals have been introduced and set up in all 11 Pacific island countries, with the expressed interest of the countries and their active engagement in using the portal as a centralised repository to store data for improved decision-making. Countries have also taken part in capacity training in data management and uploading datasets to their national portals. In addition to national portals, the regional data portal, the Pacific Environment Portal access and house data from various international sources and push this data to populate national portals. The development of national environment portals and the regional data portal supports and promotes open data systems for improved data sharing.

Papua New Guinea have recently launched a data sharing policy, an initiative of the Conservation and Environment Protection Authority (CEPA). The policy encourages the free exchange of data within CEPA, with other government agencies and institutions within PNG and with the public. Originally designed as an environment portal, the portal can serve more than just CEPA, and thus was renamed the PNG Data Portal.

Countries who are signatories to environment conventions of the multilateral environment agreements (MEAs) have reporting obligations to the conventions, and by having access to a repository of data through the national data portal reporting obligations will be easier to respond to. The same scenario applies to reporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Inform has successfully hosted South-South Knowledge Exchange on sharing experiences on open data platforms. Palau, FSM, PNG, Kiribati, and Samoa recently shared experiences on managing their national data portals with discussions focussing on current national environment data portals. Participants were re-introduced to the Inform national data portal for data management and as a storehouse for information on the environment. Participants also had hands-on training on field collection of data using a mobile app to facilitate data collection and analyses.

A Pacific Data Ecosystem promoting open data platforms is being introduced, combining the resources of SPC and SPREP for data sharing. Both regional organisations collect data on a range of development issues with the region focussing on the environment, the Pacific Data Ecosystem will increase access and sharing of data to benefit Pacific countries and territories in the areas of climate change, fisheries, energy, maritime, land resources, and the environment. The Pacific Data Hub (SPC) and the Pacific Environment Portal (PEP), as well as the country portals make up the Pacific Data Ecosystem (PDE).

BIOPAMA-Inform Project Partnership

Strengthening partnerships for the environment to help Pacific island countries better manage their natural resources is the goal of a close collaboration between two SPREP projects - the regional Inform data management project and BIOPAMA. The goal of the partnership is to help Pacific island countries better report on, and understand the status of protected areas, conservation and the environment in their respective jurisdictions.

Solomon Islands Launch Products to improve Environmental Governance

Helping Solomon Islands to further enhance environment monitoring and reporting was the launch of a national environmental online portal as well as a range of reports called the Ecosystem Resilience Analysis and Mapping Reports.The national environment portal is an online database providing a centralised data management system housing information and data on the environment for informed decision-making. The ESRAM Reports are studies to assess natural ecosystems, their current conditions, how communities use them, and what impacts of climate change are having on these ecosystems.

## Emphasis

Emphasis, aka italics, with _asterisks_ or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or **underscores**.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

## Lists

1. First ordered list item
1. Another item ⋅⋅\* Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number ⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
1. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅ ⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅ ⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

- Unordered list can use asterisks

* Or minuses

- Or pluses

## Links

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

## Code

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

```js {2}
function highlightMe() {
  console.log("This line can be highlighted!");
}
```

## Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |   Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | -----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | \$1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   \$12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    \$1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell. The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |

## Blockquotes

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text. This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can _put_ **Markdown** into a blockquote.

## Inline HTML

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>

## Line Breaks

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a _separate paragraph_.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but... This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the _same paragraph_.
