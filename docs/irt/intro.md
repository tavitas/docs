## Indicator Reporting Tool

_"The Indicator Reporting Tool aims to simplify reporting processes and reduce reporting burden by facilitating re-use of indicator definitions across multiple reporting obligations. The tool can be used for multilateral reporting obligations such as MEAs (Multilateral Environmental Agreements) as well as national and state based indicator reporting. The Indicator Reporting Tool is targetted towards government officials responsible for compiling and producing indicator based reports."_
