Clicking on **Indicator Definitions** will display a description of this function.

A list of defined indicators and their authors will be displayed in a table. The attribution will either be given to a country or to the SPREP group.

> You can either choose to use or edit an existing indicator definition, or create a new indication definition altogether. Please note you can ONLY edit a definition that was defined by someone from your own country group. For instance, a user from Cook Islands can only modify the definition of an indicator that was previously defined from another user from Cook Islands. However, he /she can only view or use but cannot modify a definition that was originally created by someone from another group/country, Solomon Islands.
