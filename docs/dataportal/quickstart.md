## DKAN

The SPREP Inform project adopted the DKAN Open Source Data Platform to implement and build the Inform network of data repositories. These repositories are intended to manage and share national, regional and global environmental information for informed decision making.

_"[DKAN](https://docs.getdkan.com/en/latest/introduction/index.html) is a open data platform with a full suite of cataloging, publishing and visualization features that allows governments, nonprofits and universities to easily publish data to the public. DKAN is maintained by CivicActions._

_DKAN is a Drupal-based open data portal based on CKAN, the first widely adopted open source open data portal software. CKAN stands for Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network. It has inspired at least one other variant - JKAN, which is built on Jekyll."_

## What is a dataset?

Datasets are containers that hold resources. They can hold metadata such as author, license type etc, and can be assigned to Groups. One dataset record may contain multiple resource records, which are used to provide multiple file formats, data variations or related information such as reports.
