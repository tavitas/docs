Your DKAN Open Data portal will have a login page located at the site’s URL with the ending /user or by clicking on the login button on the homepage as seen below. Once you’ve accessed the login page, you can log in with your account information. We suggest bookmarking the page for quick access.

### Getting your login details

For your account details, you may receive an automated email with a link and further instructions for login or simply be contacted directly by the person managing your site ie. the Site Manager. Once you receive your account information, you can access the site, log in, and begin setting up your profile.

### Log Out

When you’re done adding and editing content on the site, you’ll want to make sure you log out to avoid security risks. You can log out from anywhere on the site by using either of the buttons shown in the picture below. The blue navigation bar is not on every page of the site, but the black administration bar (the Admin Menu) always appears.
